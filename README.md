Why are you even reading this though?

## Features:
* ~~it sucks~~
* neat UI (hopefully)
*  Shutdown - Restart and logout in some time


## Requirements:
* git (cloning the repository)
* Python (if using the source code)
* pyinstaller (compiling the program, installed with `pip install pyinstaller`)


## Making an executable:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/alba4k/shutdown-timer
$ cd shutdown-timer
$ pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole ShutdownTimer.py
```
a lot of useless stuff will appear, your executable will be in a new directory called dist

It can be moved, but it should always be in the same directory as the folder named "shutdown"

## Running the python file:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/alba4k/shutdown-timer
$ cd shutdown-timer
$ python ShutdownTimer.py
```

I would also like to thank Leonardo Preda for helping me to design a nice UI
